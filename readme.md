E-Commerce Project

Introduction

I started this project with the goal of building an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products and make purchases easily. This idea was an exciting challenge to enhance my web application development skills using technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, and other tools.

Project Components

Backend

The server was built using Node.js and Express.js.
Management of users, orders, and products.
Database

MongoDB was used for data storage.
Logical schema design for orders, users, and products.
Key Features

User registration and login with encryption support (JWT).
Admin dashboard for managing products and orders.
Product ordering and total price calculation.
Linking products to different consumers and storing orders.
Challenges Faced

Handling Authentication and Authorization

Challenge: Creating a secure system for verifying user identities and their permissions.
Solution: Using JWT for authentication and ensuring that users have appropriate permissions to access resources.
Database Design

Challenge: Linking users, products, and orders in a way that allows for easy data retrieval.
Solution: Using relationships in MongoDB (e.g., populate) to reduce complexity.
Performance Optimization

Challenge: Efficiently managing orders and ensuring quick server responses.
Solution: Optimizing database queries and retrieving only the necessary data when needed.
Future Plans

I plan to enhance the project by adding the following features:

Improving the user interface and adding a responsive design for mobile devices.
Integrating payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe.
Adding instant notifications for users when orders are updated.
